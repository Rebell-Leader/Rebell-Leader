✌️Hi, nice to meet you! It's Airat.

🏆I am a results-driven NLP Research Engineer with a Ph.D. in progress and a strong track record in developing and publishing SOTA models at the intersection of AI, computational chemistry, and biology. My expertise spans multi-modal LLMs, agentic systems (RAG), and end-to-end project leadership, from initial research and model pre-training to full-stack deployment.

🌱I thrive on translating complex scientific challenges into robust, efficient AI solutions. My work has significantly accelerated data processing in personalized medicine and contributed novel models to the scientific community. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that push the boundaries of drug discovery and scientific understanding.
